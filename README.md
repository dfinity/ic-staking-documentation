# IC staking with self-custody

This is a GitHub page for creating documentation for easy self-custody staking within the Internet Computer. This is intended to be a community-driven set of documents.

You can see the GitHub page here: https://dfinity.github.io/ic-staking-documentation/

(@dprats note: the code is deployed as a github page solely to maximize public/community development + deploy. This could easily be a canister smart contract as well. That will be a good next iteration and I am working on deploying it to IC)
