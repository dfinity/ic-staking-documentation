# 4. Safest option: How to stake

If you choose to stake with the **safest option**, this chapter is for you.

This section is for people who chose to stake by custodying their own `seed phrase`

As a reminder, there are three basic steps (which change depending on the technology you choose):

**To stake, there are three steps:**

1. Generate a **private key** 
    1. *This step would only happen once 1Ô∏è‚É£ per cold wallet. For most people, this means you will do this step only once.*
2. Create a **neuron** with a **dissolve delay** 
    1. *This step would only happen once 1Ô∏è‚É£ per cold wallet. For most people, this means you will do this step only once.*
3. *Optional*: Add more ICP to the Neuron (‚Äútop up the neuron‚Äù) 
    1. *This step could happen many times üîÅ per neuron.*

This chapter explains how to accomplish these steps given one custodies their own `seed phrase`. We will follow the setup described above in [Once you have your `seed phrase`, what tools do you need to stake?](https://www.notion.so/Staking-with-self-custody-for-Dummies-5006a4da7edd4473a02cad2a58a159c6)
