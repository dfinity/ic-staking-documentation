# 1. Basic steps and concepts

When someone says that they are staking within the Internet Computer, they mean they have created a **neuron with locked ICP** with a **dissolve delay.**

To stake, these steps will not change, but the tools, commands, or methods you use may be different depending on your needs or software changes to tools.

**To stake, there are three steps:**

1. Generate a **private key**
2. Create a **neuron** with a **dissolve delay**
3. *Optional*: Add more ICP to the Neuron (“top up the neuron”)

**Once you stake, you can do any of the three activities:**

1. Set your neuron to ***vote or follow***
2. Collect your neuron’s ***rewards***
3. ***Dissolve*** your neuron to get the ICP locked inside
4. Become a vote leader: ***vote*** with your neuron
