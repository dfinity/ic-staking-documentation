    - NNS Dapp has all the functionality you need
    - This is a very common method
    - Ideal for people who want to want the easiest path to control their ICP

## Safest Option

Use your `seed phrase` directly with a few options for self-custody tools.

### Traits

    - This option is requires more technical understanding 
    - This is the *safest* option from a software point of view because you are relying on less software surface area, but it is the *riskiest* from a human point of view in that it puts the risk of your `seed phrase` custody on you.
    - Ideal for people who want as much control of their ICP as possible
