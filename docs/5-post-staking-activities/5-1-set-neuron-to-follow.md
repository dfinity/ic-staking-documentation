# 5.1. Set your neuron to ***vote or follow***

*This step could happen many times per neuron.*

**Voting is critical** for staking because only neurons which vote receive rewards.

## 5.1.1 If you chose the **maximum ease staking option**... 

You should use the [NNS frontend dapp](https://nns.ic0.app/).

## 5.1.2 If you chose the **maximum control staking option**... 

Currently, voting is not possible with `quill`. 

- To vote you can do the following:
    1. Go to the NNS frontend dapp: [https://nns.ic0.app/](https://nns.ic0.app/)

a. This may require you to get an [Internet Identity](https://identity.ic0.app/)

2. Under the `neuron` tab, you can find your principal id

3. Add this principal id as a Hot Key with `quill` to your neuron

        If you choose this, see section "5.4 Adding a hot key."

    4. You can vote with your Internet Identity via the NNS frontend dapp.
